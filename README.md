# Project: Lifehouse
**Lifehouse** is a **social media**  platform created using django as backend API and React as front-end.

## File description
Two important folders in this directory is **api** and **frontend** folder

1. **Api Folder**


2. **Frontend folder**




## How to run the application
1.**To run the API**
    Navigate into the **api** folder with a terminal or cmd and type
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    to install all the dependencies
    now run the commands
    `python manage.py makemigrations`
    `python manage.py migrate`
    `python manage.py runserver`
    and this will run the API server
2. **To run the front-end server**
    Navigate into the **frontend** folder and run the command 
    `npm install` 
    to install the dependencies and then run
    `npm start`
    to start the server




## Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project is inspired from the social media project but with higher complexity and features.
This project required Django REST framework to run as backend API and React as frontend.
The previous social media folder didn't have form of styling (custom UI) in the frontend which this project provides.
There was to no **Comments**,**Comment likes**, **Search**  or **Notifications** features in the previous project which also this project has.
